### Problem Statement 1: From the given two sets find the intersection, difference and union of them.
Test case1: Input:a={1,2,3} b={4,5,6} 
            Output: set() {1, 2, 3} {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

[print(a.intersection(b))                     
print(a.difference(b))
print(a.union(b))](https://github.com/Aishwarya-19/Game-A-Thon-Task2/blob/main/problem_01.ipynb)

### Problem Statement 2: Find the maximum and minimum value of an array.

            Output: (10, 1)

max_b = b.max()
min_b = b.min()
