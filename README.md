### Problem Statement 1: From the given two sets find the intersection, difference and union of them.
Test case1: Input: a={1,2,3} b={4,5,6} 
            Output: set() {1, 2, 3} {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

```python
take two sets of choice define them
then use following syntax for finding out intersection, difference and union  of them
print(a.intersection(b))                     
print(a.difference(b))
print(a.union(b))
```
### Problem Statement 2: Find the maximum and minimum value of an array.
Test case2: Input:b = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) 
            Output: (10, 1)
```python
first we have to import  numpy as np
then define the array with some variable
then use the following syntax for finding maximum and minimum value of the array
max_b = b.max()
min_b = b.min()
max_b,min_b
```
